#### Features and Labels

The features are the descriptive attributes, and the label is what you're attempting to predict or forecast.

## important Packages

numpy module to convert data to numpy arrays, which is what Scikit-learn wants.
Preprocessing is the module used to do some cleaning/scaling of data prior to machine learning, and model_selection is used in the testing stages.
LinearRegression algorithm as well as svm from Scikit-learn, which we'll be using as our machine learning algorithms to demonstrate results.
